        The methodology combines high-resolution historical datasets
        (CHIRPS precipitation and AgERA5 temperature, 1981–2024) with five CMIP6 climate
        models under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. Data are bias-corrected using monthly
        anomalies and standardized to 0.05° resolution. Indicators cover temperature,
        precipitation, drought and flooding stress, human heat stress, rainfall Z-scores,
        and the economic exposure of crop and livestock production to climate hazards.

            <h4>{% trans "1. Climate Data Sources" %}</h4>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}The climate risk analysis is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of historical climate data (1981–2024) obtained from observation (satellite) and model-based datasets. Specifically, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and the fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis dataset (AgERA5) were utilized to provide high-resolution historical data. The choice of including these datasets is based on their well-documented strengths in climate risk analysis, particularly for agricultural applications in Africa.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            <ul>
              <li>{% trans "CHIRPS provides high-resolution precipitation estimates by blending satellite imagery with station data, ensuring better coverage in data-sparse regions like Mozambique." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "AgERA5, derived from ECMWF’s ERA5, is optimized for agricultural modelling, offering consistent, high-quality surface climate data." %}</li>
            </ul>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}These datasets were chosen over alternatives (e.g., GPCC, CRU, ERA5-Land) due to their superior validation records, high spatial resolution, and extensive usage in climate risk studies. Future climate projections were derived from five Global Climate Models (GCMs) participating in Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The following five GCMs from CMIP6 were selected:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
             <ul>
              <li>{% trans "ACCESS-ESM1-5 (Australia’s CSIRO and BOM) – Strong representation of large-scale atmospheric circulation." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "MPI-ESM1-2-HR (Max Planck Institute, Germany) – High-resolution model known for accurate precipitation simulations." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "EC-Earth3 (EC-Earth Consortium, Europe) – Advanced coupled system for ocean-atmosphere interactions." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "INM-CM5-0 (Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Russia) – Effective in representing land-surface processes." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "MRI-ESM2-0 (Meteorological Research Institute, Japan) – Robust performance in extreme climate event projections." %}</li>
            </ul>

             <p>{% blocktrans %}These models were chosen to ensure a balance between different climate system representations and climate sensitivity, ensuring comprehensive climate risk projections. Projections were developed for two future timeframes: the near future (2021–2040) and mid-century (2041–2060). The analysis considers two emission scenarios defined by the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585. SSP245 represents a moderate emissions scenario aligned with efforts to limit global warming to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while SSP585 represents a high-emissions scenario with significantly less mitigation action.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
             <p>{% blocktrans %}We applied statistical downscaling and bias correction using a monthly climate anomaly approach, ensuring that GCM outputs align with historical observations. The bias correction process involves:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            <ul>
              <li>{% trans "Computing Monthly Climate Anomalies: Differences between simulated and observed climate conditions are calculated for each month." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "Applying These Anomalies to Historical Data: The computed anomalies are then superimposed on historical CHIRPS (precipitation) and AgERA5 (temperature) datasets." %}</li>
              <li>{% trans "Correcting Systematic Biases: The approach accounts for model-specific deviations, improving the reliability of future projections." %}</li>
            </ul>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}This method ensures that climate projections maintain consistency with historical climate trends while correcting biases in raw GCM outputs. After the downscaling, all historical and projection datasets were standardized at 0.05° spatial resolution.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
         
            <p>{% blocktrans %}In alignment with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) guidelines, baseline reference periods typically span 30 years (e.g., 1971–2000 or 1981–2010). However, for this study, the WMO’s proposed 20-year baseline interval (1995–2014) was adopted. This interval encompasses the final two decades of historical simulations using observed radiative forcings, providing a robust baseline for comparison with selected future time windows. This approach ensures the analysis remains relevant and consistent with contemporary climate assessment standards.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
         
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Several indicators were calculated to assess historical and projected climate trends as listed in table below. These metrics were selected to capture the key climatic factors influencing the region's environmental and socio-economic systems, providing a robust foundation for climate impact assessments and adaptation planning.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
